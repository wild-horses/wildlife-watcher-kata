# 2. Constraints

The few constraints on this architecture are reflected in the final solution. This section shows them and if applicable, their motivation.

## 2.1 Hardware Constraints

|     | Constraint             | Background and / or motivation                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TC1 | Ultra-low-power camera | The camera hardware will be a combination of ultra-low-power microcontrollers (up to 512KB Flash) and interchangeable modules (e.g. optical sensor, IR lights, transceiver module, batteries) enclosed in a watertight and 3D printed enclosure. |
| TC2 | Low-bandwidth network  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| TC2 | Unreliable network     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## 2.2 Organizational Constraints

|     | Constraint            | Background and / or motivation                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OC1 | Charitable trust      | We are a charitable trust that uses artificial intelligence to accelerate wildlife conservation.                                                                          |
| OC2 | Open-Source solutions | We work with grassroots wildlife conservation projects and develop open-source solutions using machine learning.                                                          |
| OC3 | Community events      | We also organise community events, seminars and educational activities to build and maintain machine learning solutions to reduce the current rate of species extinction. |
